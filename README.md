## Domain

A fictional e-commerce conducts hundreds of thousands of sales through multiple channels, including website, app, physical store, and self-checkout.
To ensure correct taxation, authorization, and sales registration, an orchestrator system is essential.
This orchestrator will be responsible for compiling the tax matrix of cart items, validating payment methods,
authorizing sales with the MidClient service, notifying channels and customers about invoice issuance, and recording all transactions in the database.

## Features

## authorize-sale.feature
### Base Scenario - Authorize sale with all valid data provided
**Given** that all valid sales data has been provided  
**When** the sale is authorized via the `/authorize-sale`    
**Then** a message containing the sale data must be published in the queue (or topic) `authorize-sale`  
**And** a response must be returned indicating that processing is in progress

## process-sale-authorization.feature
### Base Scenario - Process sale authorization with all valid data provided
**Given** that all valid sales data has been provided  
**And** that the tax matrix data is available at the `/findByCode` of the TaxClient service    
**And** that invoice data is available at the `/authorize` endpoint of the MidClient service    
**When** the sale authorization is processed via the `authorize-sale` listener    
**Then** the system must authorize the sale with its tax matrix via the `/authorize` endpoint of the MidClient service  
**And** must record the sale in the database  
**And** must publish a message containing the processed sale data and its invoice in the queue (or topic) `sale-callback`

## Architecture

The Ecommerce Checkout project was developed following the principles of clean and hexagonal architecture, aiming to isolate business rules in a Core module and allow the implementation of different infrastructures.

Currently, the following infrastructure modules have been implemented:

- **Default Infrastructure Module**: Uses Oracle as the database and RabbitMQ as the messaging system.
- **Alternative Infrastructure Module**: Uses PostgreSQL as the database and Kafka as the messaging system.

## Requirements

- Java JDK 21
- Maven 3.6.2 or higher
- Docker (Necessary for Testcontainer and to run the application locally)

## First Steps

- **Download all project dependencies**:
  ```
    mvn dependency:resolve -U
  ```
- **Build the project**: 
  ```
    mvn -U -B clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
  ```
- **Build the project and run all tests**: 
  ```
    mvn -U -B clean install
  ```

## About the Tests

To organize the tests according to their type and function, they were grouped into three main suites:

- **RunCucumberTest**: Contains all acceptance tests implemented with Cucumber and BDD. This suite has a slower execution, as it requires the initialization of the context and infrastructure.
- **UnitTests**: Contains all unit tests of the project. As it has no external dependencies, its execution is fast.
- **AllTests**: Groups all implemented tests, combining acceptance tests (RunCucumberTest) and unit tests (UnitTests).

## Getting Started with the Default Application (Oracle and RabbitMQ)

- **Wiremock**:
1. Start a Wiremock instance:
  ```
    docker-compose -f .\script\docker\wiremock.yml up -d
  ```

2. Test the Wiremock instance: [Test Wiremock](http://localhost:8443/findByCode?code=100231933559)

  service name: ORCL
  username: SYSTEM
  password: oracle

  jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/ORCL

  OBS: Sometimes the Oracle instance takes a while to start!
  ```
